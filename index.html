            <h4>Situation:</h4>
            <p>
              In my previous role as a UI/UX Designer for building a shopping app, I was tasked with enhancing the user experience, boosting company visibility, and effectively representing the brand's colors and essence
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Task:</h4>
            <p>
              My primary responsibility was to revamp the app's interface, ensuring it resonated with users while aligning with the brand's identity and objectives.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Action:</h4>
            <p>
              To start, I conducted thorough research, delving into user behaviors and preferences, and analyzed the market to identify key trends. also used app model samples such as jumia and amazon, just to mention a few. This provided insights into improving navigation, product display, and checkout processes.
              I then collaborated with the marketing team to grasp the brand's essence and colors. Utilizing this information, I devised a comprehensive color palette that both captured the brand's personality and ensured an engaging user experience.
              During the design phase, I integrated the brand's colors harmoniously into the UI, from buttons and icons to backgrounds and text. This consistency not only reinforced the brand's identity but also improved visual coherence within the app.
              Throughout the process, I engaged in iterative testing with a focus group, using their feedback to fine-tune the design. This iterative approach ensured the final design aligned perfectly with user expectations, boosting engagement and usability.

            <h4>Result:</h4>

        <h3>How often do you meet with your team during a project? Do you prefer to meet with the entire team or just team leaders? Why?</h3>

        <p>The frequency of team meetings during a project varies depending on geographical considerations. Typically, we have daily virtual check-ins to ensure constant communication with all necessary  alignment. Although, when needed, we schedule more extended meetings to delve into specific topics. This approach facilitates a streamlined and adaptable communication process that supports project progress.</p>

  <li><h3>How do you approach task assignment within your team? :</h3>

    <p>My approach to task assignment revolves around leveraging individuals' strengths. Team members choose tasks aligning with their skillsets, allowing them to contribute effectively. If someone demonstrates the ability to work cross-functionally, we integrate them seamlessly into relevant areas. This method ensures a streamlined process where each specialist brings their expertise to the table. As we progress, key team members take charge of final stages, facilitating smooth information flow, navigation, and the integration of objectives. This approach prevents information overload and fosters coherent collaboration.</p>

    <h3>Describe a time when you realised your current approach wasn’t working and how did you resolve it ? : </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Situation:</h4>
        <p>
          During a project, I took on the role of making all decisions, assuming I had all the answers required for its success.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Task:</h4>
        <p>
          I needed to address the realization that my approach lacked fresh perspectives and was hindering the project's progress.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Action:</h4>
        <p>
          Recognizing the need for change, I shifted the power dynamic within the team. Instead of centralizing decision-making, I distributed autonomy among team members. We adopted a group voting system to collectively determine the most suitable course of action. Additionally, I introduced user testing to validate our decisions and refine our approach based on real-world feedback.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Result:</h4>
        <p>
          By embracing this revised strategy, the project experienced notable improvements. The diversification of decision-making empowered team members, fostering innovative solutions. The implementation of user testing provided valuable insights, enabling us to fine-tune our approach for better outcomes. This adjustment not only resolved the initial roadblock but also led to enhanced teamwork, decision-making, and overall project success.

<h3>Describe your experience in working with Agile Methodology? :</h3>
      <p>Working with Agile methodology has provided me with the opportunity to cultivate a work environment where every aspect of my contribution is meticulously refined. This approach encourages a commitment to ensuring the completeness and effectiveness of my assigned tasks.

        Furthermore, Agile's emphasis on cross-functional collaboration has led to a habit of consistently sharing opinions and insights among team members. This not only promotes a culture of learning but also contributes directly to the advancement of the project's objectives.
        
        In summary, my experience with Agile methodology has shown me the significance of both individual accountability and collective knowledge sharing. It's an approach that aligns well with my inclination for thoroughness and my appreciation for collaborative teamwork.</p>
